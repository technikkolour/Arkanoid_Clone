Halloween:
It is October 31st, Halloween night, and you and your friends go trick or treating in your neighbourhood. You have managed to collect a good amount of treats that you are planning to secretly enjoy over the next week (your parents are dentists and they wouldn't let you eat it). Suddenly you hear a sound in the he neighbourhood bullies are bad and they find you and try to steal your candy. 

You must defeat them in a game of dodgeball in order to protect your treats and your honour.
